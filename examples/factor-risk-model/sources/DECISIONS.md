# Design decisions

Decisions made 2026-08-19 at project start. Revisit deliberately; each bump
of `ModelConfig.version` should reference the decision that changed.

## 1. Flagship methodology: fundamental factor model

Barra-style: style + industry factors, cross-sectional regressions, factor
covariance + specific risk. Chosen over statistical (PCA) because
interpretability is the product — agents need to *explain* risk, not just
quantify it. SEC EDGAR's XBRL API makes the fundamentals side free and
public domain, which is what makes an open-source version viable at all.
A statistical model may be added later as a validation baseline.

## 2. Data strategy: hybrid

We publish precomputed model artifacts (exposures, factor covariance,
specific risk — derived data, safe to redistribute) *and* ship the full
pipeline so anyone can rebuild with their own price source. Raw prices are
never redistributed. Fundamentals/SIC: EDGAR (public domain). Prices:
pluggable providers — Yahoo chart API is the keyless default (unofficial
endpoint, redistribution-restricted, hence artifacts-only distribution);
Tiingo with a key; stooq kept but currently behind a JS challenge. Users
must check their provider's terms for their own rebuilds.

## 3. Agent interface: Python package + MCP server

`pip install riskprism` for the math; `riskprism-mcp` for agents. A hosted REST
API was deliberately deferred (hosting cost/ops without proven demand).

## 4. Frontend: static explorer, zero backend (added 2026-08-19)

A single self-contained HTML page (`site/template.html`) with the model
data embedded as JSON by `riskprism-site`; all risk math re-implemented
client-side (~60 lines of JS). Chosen over a hosted app because the entire
model fits in ~100KB, which makes a server pure liability. Views: factor
returns/vol/correlation, portfolio sandbox with stress sliders, per-stock
profiles, methodology walkthrough, agent onboarding.

Hosting (2026-08-19): Railway, serving the `site/` directory via a Caddy
Dockerfile — the user's platform choice; the site is plain static files so
it deploys anywhere. The weekly Action re-renders and commits
`site/index.html` + `site/model.md` + `site/llms.txt`, then redeploys via
`railway up` when the RAILWAY_TOKEN secret is set.

Agent endpoint: every build also renders `/model.md` (llms.txt-style
markdown mirror — model card, factor definitions, correlations, coverage)
because a JS-rendered page is hostile to text-only agents.

## 5. Coverage via priors + capture-forward history (v0.2, 2026-08-19)

Split the estimation universe (liquid names that estimate factor returns)
from the coverage universe (everything alive at build date). Coverage
names get risk through the factor structure plus a structural specific-risk
model (ln vol regressed on size/volatility/liquidity/industry), blended
with their own EWMA by w = T/(T+26w) — so IPOs and illiquid names are
covered with explicit, inspectable priors (`asset_meta.parquet`).

Survivorship: rejected buying delisted-price data (CRSP/Sharadar/Norgate —
paid, redistribution-restricted; free sources only provide delisting
*lists*, not prices). Instead: capture-forward. Weekly builds append to the
prior release's factor-return/residual history; disappearing names get a
Shumway-style imputed delisting return (−30% under $5, else 0) and keep
their rows. With 13/26-week half-lives the biased cold start decays out
within ~18–24 months — the bias is documented and self-liquidating.

## 6. Refresh: weekly GitHub Actions

Cron builds the model weekly and publishes the artifact directory. Weekly
matches the medium-horizon design; daily refresh only matters for
short-horizon/trading use, which is out of scope for v1.

## Defaults adopted without much debate (revisit as needed)

- **Horizon**: medium (weekly returns). Short-horizon daily model = v2 idea.
- **Industries**: Fama-French 12 from SIC codes — public, stable, avoids GICS
  licensing. Coarser than commercial models; acceptable for v1.
- **Point-in-time**: fundamentals use EDGAR `filed` dates (no lookahead), but
  the price panel is a *current* snapshot — delisted names are missing, so
  historical factor returns have survivorship bias. Documented loudly in
  METHODOLOGY; fixing this properly (delisted-price archive) is the single
  biggest v2 data improvement.
- **Universe heuristics**: 1-5 letter tickers, one per CIK (shortest = primary
  class), price/ADV floors. Crude but transparent.
- **Stack**: Python 3.11+, numpy/pandas, parquet. pandas over polars for v1 —
  ubiquity beats speed at this data size; revisit if the pipeline slows.
- **License**: MIT (code). Artifacts: derived data, distributed with
  attribution of sources.
- **Naming** (decided 2026-08-19): `riskprism` — a prism decomposes light
  into its spectrum; the model decomposes portfolio risk into a factor
  spectrum. Free on PyPI, keeps "risk" searchable, and gives the frontend
  its visual identity. Runners-up: `beaufort`, `loadings`. Model version
  string: `PRISM-US-MH-x.y` (US, Medium Horizon).

## 7. v0.3: the USE4-documented adjustments (decided 2026-08-20)

Literature review (Bloomberg MAC2/MAC3 decks, Barra USE4 Methodology
Notes, Axioma AXUS4 factsheet — links in METHODOLOGY) ranked our gaps by
the impact the vendors measured. Implemented, in that order:

1. **Volatility Regime Adjustment** (factor + specific): EWMA (8-week
   half-life) of the cross-sectional bias statistic, applied as a vol
   multiplier clipped to [0.5, 2]. Chosen first because USE4's published
   evidence is dramatic (rolling bias pinned near 1.0 through 2008–09 vs
   1.3→0.7 unadjusted) and it directly targets our measured
   Mincer–Zarnowitz slope of 0.70.
2. **Optimized portfolios in the validation panel**: min-variance +
   3 random-alpha min-risk portfolios (Woodbury Σ⁻¹, top 500 by cap),
   scored weekly like every other test portfolio. Measure before fixing:
   this is the documented 1.4–1.5-bias failure mode and no public model
   (commercial or open) publishes it continuously.
3. **Newey-West variance adjustment**: Bartlett, 2 lags on factor
   variances, 1 lag on specific — weekly ×52 annualization assumes iid;
   momentum's measured 1.40 realized/forecast daily-vol ratio says
   otherwise. Variance-only keeps V·C·V PSD without extra repair.
4. **Bayesian specific shrinkage**: USE4's q=0.1 distance-dependent
   shrinkage toward size-decile means (equal-weighted buckets on the size
   exposure — deviation from USE4's cap-weighting, chosen so the step is
   reproducible from shipped exposures alone).

Architectural consequence: **validation is now recomputed from history on
every build** (`model/revalidate.py`) rather than accrued across builds —
bias statistics always grade the shipped methodology, exactly (the weekly
regression identity r = Xf + ε makes replayed returns equal true returns
for regressed names, delisting imputations included). v0.2 regression
history carries forward across this version bump
(`compatible_prior_versions`): exposure/regression definitions are
unchanged, and discarding the prior would have re-introduced the
survivorship bias its capture-forward rows exist to prevent.

## 8. v0.4 plan: optimization-bias correction (written 2026-08-20)

The remaining big documented failure mode: optimizers seek out the
covariance matrix's underestimated directions (Shepard 2009: true vol of
an optimized portfolio ≈ predicted/(1−K/T)). Two published fixes; we now
measure the disease continuously (decision 7.2), so the cure is chosen on
our own evidence:

- **Phase 0 — measure (shipping now)**: watch the `opt` group's bias
  statistics for a few builds. With K=20 factors and T≈150 effective
  weeks, Shepard's formula predicts ≈ 1/(1−20/150) ≈ 1.15 before
  estimation noise in specific risk — expect roughly 1.1–1.3, milder than
  USE4's 1.4–1.6 (they have K=60+ industries and optimize harder).
- **Phase A — eigenfactor risk adjustment** (Menchero, Wang & Orr 2011,
  Appendix A): diagonalize F, Monte-Carlo the per-eigenfactor volatility
  bias (simulate T weeks from F ~1,000 times — trivial at K=20), de-bias
  eigenvariances with the paper's scaled variant (a=1.4), rotate back.
  Implement in `model/covariance.py` behind `config.eigen_adjust`;
  the replayed validation state gets the same treatment (adjust the
  weekly factor_cov_weekly output).
- **Phase B — correlation blending** (Bloomberg MAC2/MAC3, Menchero &
  Lazanas 2019): C ← w·C_sample + (1−w)·C_PCA(J), J = ⌈μK⌉ ≈ 5
  components + idiosyncratic diagonal, starting from Bloomberg's
  published (w=0.8, μ=0.25). Same config-flag treatment.
- **Decision rule**: one build per variant; compare (a) `opt`-group bias
  statistics (closer to 1 wins), (b) non-opt portfolios' bias unchanged
  within noise (the adjustment must not distort ordinary portfolios —
  USE4 checked style vols for this), (c) out-of-sample realized vol of
  the min-variance portfolio (lower wins; the De Nard–Ledoit–Wolf
  criterion). Ship the winner; keep the loser behind its flag with the
  comparison documented here.
- **Non-goals**: full Ledoit-Wolf nonlinear shrinkage (K=20 is small; the
  factor-covariance conditioning problem commercial models fight barely
  exists at our K) and daily-returns re-estimation (a separate, larger
  project — would change regression definitions and force a cold
  rebuild).

## 9. v0.4 result: correlation blending ships; eigenfactor adjustment is an honest negative (decided 2026-08-21)

Executed the §8 plan. Both cures implemented in `model/covariance.py`
(`config.factor_cov_adjust`: "blend" / "eigen" / "none"), A/B'd by full
validation replay over the same 123 scored weeks. Bias statistics by
group (1.0 = calibrated; minvar = the global min-variance portfolio
optimized against the model):

| variant | minvar | opt avg | style | market | random | equal | industry |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| none (v0.3) | 1.36 | 1.20 | 1.16 | 1.04 | 0.93 | 0.98 | 0.99 |
| eigen a=1.4 | 0.98 | 1.11 | 0.92 | 0.97 | **0.75** | **0.77** | 0.86 |
| eigen a=1.0 | 1.04 | 1.13 | 0.97 | 0.99 | **0.80** | **0.81** | 0.89 |
| eigen, median/trace/tapered variants | 1.06–1.29 | 1.12–1.19 | 0.99–1.10 | ~1.0 | 0.81–0.87 | 0.83–0.90 | 0.90–0.97 |
| **blend w=0.8, J=5 (shipped)** | **1.29** | **1.18** | 1.16 | 1.04 | 0.94 | 0.99 | 0.99 |

Findings:

- The eigenfactor Monte-Carlo reproduces USE4's headline exactly — our
  smallest eigenfactors are underestimated ~41% (they report ~40%) — and
  the adjustment does fix the optimized portfolios and even the style
  spreads. But at K=20 factors and an effective T≈37 weeks (13-week vol
  half-life), the profile inflates *mid-rank* eigenvalues ~20%, and broad
  long-only portfolios (equal-weight, random baskets) that were
  calibrated become badly over-forecast. Robustified profiles (median
  ratios, trace-preserving, rank-tapered) do not rescue it: the
  mid-rank variance eigen adds overlaps directions real portfolios hold.
  USE4's setting (K=65+, daily returns, effective T≈1000) does not
  transfer to a small-K weekly model. Eigen stays implemented behind the
  flag for anyone who wants it.
- Correlation blending at Bloomberg's *published* parameters (w=0.8,
  J=⌈K/4⌉=5 — deliberately not tuned on our own validation) improves the
  optimized portfolios modestly with zero measurable effect on any other
  group. Shipped as the v0.4 default.
- The residual minvar bias (~1.29) is consistent with Shepard's
  second-order risk arising substantially from *specific*-risk
  estimation noise (the optimizer selects the luckiest low-s² names),
  which no factor-covariance adjustment can reach. Candidate future
  work: stronger specific shrinkage, or reporting Shepard's analytic
  1/(1−K/T) correction alongside optimized-portfolio forecasts. The
  weekly `opt` validation rows keep measuring it either way.
- The out-of-sample realized vol of the min-variance portfolio was
  *lowest under the unadjusted matrix* (4.6% vs 4.8–4.9% adjusted) — at
  our scale the optimization bias manifests as understated forecasts,
  not as materially worse optimized portfolios.

Version bumped to PRISM-US-MH-0.4; 0.2/0.3 regression history carries
forward (`compatible_prior_versions`), validation rescored as always.


## 10. v0.5: daily estimation — weekly formation, daily regressions (decided 2026-08-21)

The question that forced it: an EWMA's effective sample size is pinned by
its half-life in OBSERVATIONS (N_eff = (1+λ)/(1−λ)), not by how much
history accumulates — so the weekly model's correlation matrix was
permanently limited to ~75 effective observations (26-week half-life),
vs ~1,450 for USE4's daily 504-day half-life. That noise ratio is what
made factor expansion dangerous (§9's eigen result) and what made
optimized portfolios underforecast. Daily sampling buys ~730 effective
observations at a 252-day half-life with BETTER calendar responsiveness.

Design: **weekly formation, daily estimation.** Exposures still form on
Fridays (the fundamentals pipeline is untouched); five daily WLS
regressions run per week against the frozen exposures. Half-lives move
to the published daily template (vol 84d = USE4S, corr 252d ≈ Axioma MH,
VRA 42d = USE4S, NW 5 factor lags). Validation still scores 1-week-ahead
forecasts (daily state variance × 5); weekly returns are reconstructed
EXACTLY by compounding the daily regression identity. ETF RBSA moves to
trailing daily returns (252d window — ~5× the observations of the old
52-week window).

Why now and not later: the switch requires a cold rebuild (daily and
weekly regression histories are incommensurable), and the one asset a
cold rebuild destroys — capture-forward survivorship-free history — was
essentially empty (the founding build was days old; every banked week
was cold-start). The cost of this switch grows every week the cron runs;
it will never be cheaper. Deferring it again would have been inertia.

Also shipped in the same version (one coherent recalibration):
- **Shepard flag**: `portfolio_risk(optimized=True)` / MCP
  `get_portfolio_risk(optimized=true)` applies the analytic second-order
  correction 1/(1−K/N_eff) at the REPORTING layer — the resolution of
  §9's impossibility (one matrix can't be unbiased for both fixed and
  optimizer-selected portfolios): fixed portfolios keep the unbiased
  matrix, optimized ones get the selection correction.
- **Factor QC stats**: per-regression WLS t-statistics ship as
  factor_tstats.parquet and a %-significant table in /model.md
  (Axioma publishes the same check).
- Deliberately NOT bundled: new descriptors and FF30 industries (v0.6) —
  stacking the biggest frequency change with the biggest factor change
  would make regressions unattributable.

### §10 addendum: the daily-regime A/B (measured 2026-08-21)

Rerunning the §9 A/B on the v0.5 daily artifacts (121 scored weeks):

| variant | minvar | opt avg | style | random | equal |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| none | 1.088 | 1.142 | 1.124 | 0.905 | 0.923 |
| blend (default) | 1.085 | 1.142 | 1.125 | 0.905 | 0.923 |
| eigen | 1.031 | 1.128 | 1.070 | 0.874 | 0.887 |

Findings: (a) daily estimation itself was the real optimization-bias
cure — min-var fell 1.36 → 1.09 before any matrix adjustment, matching
Shepard's 1/(1−K/N_eff) with N_eff from the VOL half-life (84d → 243 obs
→ 1.090) almost exactly, which is why the `optimized=true` reporting
flag uses the vol half-life; (b) at ~730 correlation observations,
blending is inert (≤0.003 everywhere) — kept as the default anyway as
free conditioning insurance for the v0.6 factor expansion; (c) eigen's
trade-off turns mild but remains a trade (helps minvar/styles ~0.05,
worsens random/equal ~0.03) — still off by default. MZ slope healed from
0.81 to 1.02 with the frequency switch alone.

## 11. v0.6: value and quality become multi-descriptor composites (decided 2026-08-21)

**Decision.** Rebuild the two weakest style factors as composites, exactly
the USE4/Axioma construction:

- **value** = mean of available z-scores of book/price (book > 0),
  earnings/price, operating-cash-flow/price, sales/price
- **quality** = mean of available z-scores of ROE, ROA, operating cash
  flow/assets, gross margin (GrossProfit tag, falling back to
  Revenues − CostOfRevenue)

Each descriptor is winsorized and z-scored on the estimation universe;
the composite averages only the z-scores a filer actually has (a missing
XBRL tag drops out of the mean rather than pulling the score to 0), is
industry-median imputed at the descriptor level, then winsorized and
re-standardized. K is unchanged (20) — this changes the *meaning* of two
columns of X, not the factor count, which keeps the change attributable.

**Why these two first.** The v0.5 factor-QC table measured value
significant in 4% of the 713 daily cross-sections and quality in 1% —
against market 86%, volatility 83%, momentum 75%. Both were
single-descriptor (B/P and ROE): the axes existed but carried almost no
independent return variance. Commercial models never run these factors
single-descriptor; USE4's value and earnings-quality factors and
Axioma's value/profitability blocks are all descriptor composites.

**Data feasibility (verified on SEC bulk archives before building):**
OCF tag ~98% of filers, Revenues ~76% (plus contract-revenue fallbacks),
GrossProfit ~46% direct but ~60%+ with the CostOfRevenue fallback.
Consensus-estimate descriptors (forward E/P) are skipped — IBES-class
data is proprietary, and staying redistributable is the project's spine.

**Cost.** Exposure definitions changed → v0.5 daily factor returns are
not commensurable → `compatible_prior_versions = ()` and a cold rebuild.
Still nearly free (capture-forward history barely exceeds provider
lookback), and it gets more expensive every week — the same "never
cheaper than now" argument as §10.

**Gate (measured after the rebuild, below).** Ship if: value/quality
%-significant rises materially; mean daily R² does not fall; validation
scoreboard (bias, MZ slope, opt rows) does not degrade; style-portfolio
bias stats for value/quality do not worsen.

### §11 result (measured 2026-08-21): gate passed, shipped

Cold rebuild, 713 daily regressions over the same 149 weeks, 121 scored:

- **quality: 1.6% → 49.2% of cross-sections significant** — the composite
  turned a dead axis into a mid-table factor (between liquidity 62% and
  the median industry). Its style-portfolio bias improved 1.26 → 1.14.
- **value: 4.1% → 11.7%** — a 3× improvement but still the weakest style.
  Its style-portfolio bias moved 1.00 → 1.24: the honest reading is that
  v0.5's perfect 1.00 was the calibration of a factor with nothing to
  forecast, while the composite axis now carries real variance the young
  EWMA history is still learning. Watch item, not a rollback trigger —
  same band as leverage (1.47), and every aggregate stayed put.
- Mean daily R² 0.156 → 0.159. VIF: value 1.03, quality 1.23. The new
  quality axis anti-correlates with volatility (ρ = −0.39), the classic
  profitability/low-vol relationship — expected, not collinear.
- Scoreboard unmoved: overall bias 1.05 → 1.05, min-var opt 1.08 → 1.07,
  ETFs 0.97, market 1.02, MZ slope 1.02 → 1.10.
- Exposure correlation with v0.5: value 0.67 (B/P still the spine),
  quality 0.12 (ROE alone was mostly noise; the axis genuinely changed).

Remaining value gap is plausibly structural for this window (2024–2026
had no sustained value rotation) and partly the missing forward-E/P
descriptor (IBES-class, proprietary, deliberately skipped). Next levers
if it stays weak: dividend yield as a separate factor (v0.7 candidate)
and a longer history. Leverage (34% significant, bias 1.47) is now the
weakest calibrated style and the next QC target.

## 12. v0.7: beta split — Market Sensitivity separated from Residual Volatility (decided 2026-08-22)

**Change.** v0.6's `volatility` style (raw 252-day total return std)
conflated two dimensions every commercial model carries separately:
how hard a name leans on the market (USE4 "Beta", Axioma "Market
Sensitivity") and how much it moves on its own (USE4 "Residual
Volatility"). v0.7 splits them with one time-series regression per name —
daily returns over the 252-day window on the cap-weighted market return
(weights fixed at as-of caps; the market is defined on the estimation
universe, so coverage-only names can't move their own benchmark). Beta is
the slope; volatility becomes the annualized residual std, then
cross-sectionally orthogonalized to beta and re-standardized (USE4 does
the same for its HSIGMA descriptor). K: 20 → 21.

**Cost.** Exposure definitions changed → cold rebuild,
`compatible_prior_versions = ()` — same never-cheaper-than-now economics
as §10/§11.

**Gate.** Ship if: beta lands materially significant; volatility stays
significant; no style collapses; VIF stays bounded; validation scoreboard
(bias, exceedances, MZ slope, opt rows, ETFs) does not degrade.

### §12 result (measured 2026-08-22): gate passed, shipped

Cold rebuild, 713 daily regressions over the same 149 weeks, 121 scored:

- **beta: significant in 83.7% of daily cross-sections, mean |t| 8.2** —
  instantly the second-strongest factor in the model, behind only the
  market itself (87.0%). Its style portfolio scores bias 0.94 from day
  one. Week-to-week exposure autocorrelation 0.995.
- **volatility (now residual, beta-orthogonalized): 82.0% → 73.9%
  significant** — the expected transfer: beta absorbed the market-lean
  component, and what remains is still a top-five style. Its VIF
  *improved* 1.47 → 1.23, exposure-level corr(beta, volatility) = 0.00
  by construction, and its style-portfolio bias is fine (0.98 → 1.05).
- The old axis genuinely decomposed: v0.6 total vol correlates 0.78 with
  the new residual vol and 0.57 with the new beta.
- **Mean daily R² 0.159 → 0.178** — the largest single-change R² gain
  since daily estimation itself.
- Scoreboard improved across the board: overall bias 1.05 → 1.01,
  |z|>1.96 rate 6.4% → 5.7%, MZ slope 1.10 → 1.04, min-var opt
  1.07 → 1.01, ETF pooled bias 0.97 → 0.97. Market-portfolio bias moved
  1.02 → 0.90 (mildly conservative now; inside the acceptance band —
  watch item). No other style moved materially (value 1.24 → 1.24,
  leverage 1.47 → 1.50).
- Max style VIF 1.82 (size–liquidity, pre-existing).

Leverage remains the weakest calibrated style (32% significant, bias
1.50) — unchanged by this split, and now clearly the next QC target
(v0.8, alongside growth and dividend yield candidates).

## 13. v0.8 style work: growth ships, leverage becomes a composite, dividend yield is an honest negative (decided 2026-08-22)

**Changes measured** (one cold rebuild at FF12 with all three, then gated
per factor):

- **Leverage rebuilt as a 3-descriptor composite** — book leverage
  (TL/TA), debt-to-equity (TL/BE), market leverage (TL/(TL+ME)). The
  single liabilities/assets descriptor was the weakest calibrated style
  (32% of cross-sections significant, style-portfolio bias 1.50).
  Measured: **47.2% significant (mean |t| 2.24), style bias 1.50 → 1.11,
  exceedances 21.5% → 9.1%**, VIF 1.22. Ships.
- **Growth** — normalized slope of up-to-five point-in-time annual
  revenue filings (the v0.6 fundamentals ingestion already carried the
  history; at least three fiscal years required, industry-median
  imputed). Measured: **41.8% significant (mean |t| 1.93)**, VIF 1.08,
  week-to-week stability 0.994, style bias 1.15 — mid-table from day one,
  above quality's 1.6% starting point by thirty-fold. Ships.
- **Dividend yield** — annual PaymentsOfDividends over market cap,
  absence treated as a genuine zero. Measured: **significant in 0.0% of
  daily cross-sections (mean |t| 0.27)** and correlated 0.56 with value,
  dragging value's VIF from 1.02 to 1.51 for nothing in return. Daily
  return cross-sections simply do not price a slow, mostly-constant
  yield spread. **Rejected** — same honest-negative treatment as the
  eigenfactor adjustment (§9). The `dividends_paid` EDGAR ingestion
  stays (cheap, point-in-time, and a future value-descriptor candidate).

Scoreboard on the all-three build: overall bias 1.010 → 0.984,
|z|>1.96 5.7% → 4.9%, min-var opt 1.01 → 0.98, market 0.90 flat. The
shipped v0.9 build carries growth + the leverage composite without
dividend yield; §14 adds the industry axis.

## 14. v0.9: FF12 → FF30 industries (decided 2026-08-22)

**Change.** Industries move from the Fama-French 12 scheme to FF30,
parsed from Ken French's published `Siccodes30` definitions (587 SIC
ranges — public domain, auditable, no GICS license). K: 21 → 40
(market + 9 styles + 30 industries). Cold rebuild (exposure definitions
changed; shares the build with §13's style work).

**The K=40 question.** The Shepard floor for portfolios optimized
against the model rises with K (≈1.20 at 84d/K=40 vs 1.09 at K=21), and
§9 documented the eigenfactor adjustment overcorrecting at K=20 — so the
risk was that finer industries buy R² at the cost of optimized-portfolio
calibration.

### §14 result (measured 2026-08-22): gate passed, shipped

- **Mean daily R² 0.181 → 0.212** — the largest explanatory gain of any
  change shipped so far (daily cross-sections at FF12 left industry
  co-movement on the table).
- **Optimized portfolios did not degrade: min-var bias 0.98 → 0.99.**
  Correlation blending plus ~730 effective daily observations absorb
  K=40 comfortably; the measured bias sits far below the theoretical
  floor because the blend suppresses exactly the noise directions
  optimizers hunt. The `optimized=true` reporting correction now scales
  with K=40 for callers who want the conservative number.
- Scoreboard flat at ideal: overall bias 0.984 → 0.987, |z|>1.96
  4.9% → 5.1% (5,786 portfolio-week scores — the industry panel grew
  from 11 to 24 scoreable portfolios). Industry-portfolio pooled bias
  0.92.
- Industry significance: median 34% of daily cross-sections, range
  2%–69%. The thin tail is tiny industries (Txtls 3 names, Smoke 6,
  Coal 6) — noisy factor estimates but identification-neutral and
  calibrated in aggregate; they'd merge away under FF48-style grouping
  if they ever misbehave. Highest industry vols are sensible (Coal 43%,
  Mines 38%, Oil 28%).
- Watch items carried forward: growth style bias 1.20 (young factor,
  same young-EWMA pattern value showed in §11), market portfolio 0.92
  (mildly conservative).
- **Eigenfactor A/B re-run at K=40** (same-day, via config-replay on the
  shipped artifacts — no rebuild needed since §12's variant machinery):
  blend overall 0.99 / min-var 0.99; eigen overall **0.93** / min-var
  **0.91** — the eigenfactor adjustment still overcorrects broad
  portfolios and now overcorrects the min-var case past calibration too;
  no-adjustment scores 0.99 / 1.02. §9's verdict stands at K=40:
  **correlation blending ships**.

Coverage remains ~3,000 names; the raise toward the ~8,000 EDGAR
candidates is the remaining half of the roadmap's v0.9 line.

## 15. Coverage raised to the EDGAR universe — estimation stays pinned (decided 2026-08-22)

**Change.** The candidate pool widens from the ~3,000 largest EDGAR
names to ~8,000; coverage goes 2,987 → **6,307**. Three builds to get it
honest:

1. **Naive raise (rejected).** Widening the pool let ~900 marginal names
   through the estimation screens (2,774 → 3,698). Style-portfolio
   calibration blew up (leverage 2.39, size 2.39), overall bias
   0.99 → 1.22, and the structural specific-risk prior extrapolated to
   absurdities on the new tail (p95 = 1089%/yr).
2. **ADV-rank cap (rejected).** Capping estimation at the 3,000 most
   liquid names fixed the size but changed the composition — small
   high-turnover names displaced quiet large caps, and the style-extreme
   deciles load on exactly those names: panel-matched style bias
   1.12 → 1.57 while market/ETF/industry/optimized portfolios were
   unchanged. The diagnosis in one line: coverage was leaking into the
   estimation universe.
3. **EDGAR-order pool cap (shipped).** The estimation candidate pool is
   the first `estimation_max_names` EDGAR-ordered names (≈ market cap) —
   byte-identical estimation to the prior build — and coverage alone
   widens. The structural prior is also clipped to the fit
   distribution's [q01, 1.5×q99] against exp() extrapolation.

### §15 result: gate passed, shipped

- Coverage 2,987 → 6,307; estimation exactly 2,774 (unchanged names).
- Panel-matched scoreboard vs the 3,000-name build: overall 0.987 vs
  0.989; styles 1.124 vs 1.125; market/ETF/industry/optimized all within
  noise. Full panel (now 135 weeks — the wider pool starts regressions
  14 weeks earlier, deepening the replayed record): bias 0.988,
  |z|>1.96 5.2%.
- Extended tail: 3,533 prior-driven names, specific vol median 47%,
  p95 167%, max 176% — the clip holds.
- Mean daily R² 0.205 vs 0.212 (a day-composition effect of the deeper
  panel, not a universe change — the cross-sections are identical).

The lesson worth keeping: **coverage and estimation are different
products.** Coverage is a reach claim; estimation is a quality claim.
Every commercial model pins the estimation universe by construction —
now so do we, explicitly.

## 16. v1.0 stability track: schema freeze, PyPI packaging, model registry (decided 2026-08-23)

Not a methodology change — the infrastructure half of the roadmap's v1.0
milestone. No rebuild; the model stays PRISM-US-MH-0.9.

- **Artifact schema frozen at version 1.** `save_artifacts` stamps
  `artifact_schema_version` into every `meta.json` (derived variants
  inherit it through the shared writer); `load_artifacts` reads
  unstamped pre-freeze directories as schema 1 and refuses anything
  newer than it understands. The freeze promise — required files and
  columns never change within a schema version; optional additions
  stay allowed — is documented file-by-file in ARTIFACTS.md, verified
  against the shipped `model-2026-08-22b` release.
- **PyPI packaging.** Package version moves 0.1.0 → 0.9.0 and tracks
  the model version line (1.0.0 at the v1.0 declaration). Publishing
  is automated via trusted publishing on `v*` release tags
  (`publish.yml`, with a tag/version match guard); weekly `model-*`
  releases never trigger it. The name `riskprism` was unclaimed on
  PyPI as of 2026-08-23. Two release tracks documented in RELEASING.md.
- **Versioned model registry.** The `model-*` release history *is* the
  registry — `riskprism.registry` turns it into a machine-readable
  catalog (tag, parsed model version, horizons, artifact URLs) rather
  than maintaining a second database that could drift. Served as
  `GET /api/v1/registry` and the `list_model_versions` MCP tool;
  `download_artifacts(tag)` fetches any historical build. Verified
  live: the v0.6 build downloads by tag and loads as schema 1.

What v1.0 still requires: the actual first PyPI publish (a one-time
trusted-publisher setup on pypi.org — RELEASING.md) and **at least one
year of uninterrupted live weekly out-of-sample record**, which only
time delivers. The weekly builds have run since 2026-08-20.
